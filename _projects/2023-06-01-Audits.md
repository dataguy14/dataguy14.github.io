**Goal:** To digitize and centralize the tracking of leadership round and audit observations, enabling real-time visibility, efficient monitoring, and streamlined closure processes.
\
**Challenges:** The process relied on manual note-taking during rounds, with no centralized repository for historical data. Monitoring the status of observations was cumbersome, and there was limited visibility of observations at the departmental level.
\
**Approach:**
\
**Digital Transformation:** Developed a digital observation recorder to replace manual note-taking, ensuring centralized and consistent data collection.\
**Data Analysis & Sharing:** Implemented data transformation processes to analyze and share observations efficiently, enabling actionable insights.\
**Streamlined Closure Process:** Designed a dashboard that allowed departments to view, track, and close observations directly, with status indicators such as open, closed, in-process, and evidence of closure.\
**Impact:** The project enabled near real-time collection and visibility of observations at area and departmental levels. The improved closure process streamlined workflows, while the dashboard provided clear status updates, fostering accountability and transparency. This initiative revolutionized the audit and observation tracking system, driving operational efficiency and enhancing oversight.
