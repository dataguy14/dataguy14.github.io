**Goal:** To digitize the preventive maintenance process (PPM) for HVAC systems, ensuring efficient tracking, accurate records, and improved system performance.
\
**Challenges:** The existing system lacked a structured PPM process, historical data was unavailable, and manual record-keeping led to inefficiencies and gaps in maintenance tracking.
\
**Approach:** QR Code Integration: Deployed QR codes across HVAC systems to enable seamless digital tracking and real-time record updates.\
**Redefining PPM Processes:** Updated and standardized the PPM checklist to ensure comprehensive maintenance and consistent performance monitoring.\
**Centralized Dashboard:** Developed a monitoring dashboard to track PPM activities, identify maintenance issues, and ensure timely resolution.\
**Impact:** The initiative transitioned the HVAC PPM process to a paperless system, reducing manual effort and costs. Digital records improved historical data availability, while the centralized dashboard facilitated proactive issue identification and enhanced system performance. This transformation not only streamlined maintenance but also contributed to better operational efficiency and reliability.
