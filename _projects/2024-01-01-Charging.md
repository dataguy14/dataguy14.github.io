**Data Integration and Modeling:** Consolidated data from multiple sources to create a unified view of outpatient orders and charges.\
**Monitoring System Development:** Designed a compliance tracking system to monitor orders received versus charged on the same day.\
**Insights for Leadership:** Provided initial analysis through integrated dashboards, highlighting areas for operational improvement.\
**Impact:**
\
**Operational Efficiency:** Enabled leadership to identify bottlenecks and optimize order processing workflows.\
**Revenue Enhancement:** Improved charging compliance led to a steady increase in daily revenue.\
**Data-Driven Decisions:** Equipped leadership with actionable insights to drive continuous improvements in operational and financial performance.\
**This project demonstrates my ability to transform fragmented operational data into actionable insights, driving financial growth and operational excellence through innovative and integrated solutions.**
