**Goal:** To streamline and automate the evaluation of professional practices by eliminating manual processes, enabling efficient performance monitoring, and addressing a 3-year backlog in consultant appraisals.
\
**Challenges:** The evaluation process relied heavily on manual data extraction, entry, and calculations across multiple sources for each consultant. This time-consuming approach led to inefficiencies, delays, and an inability to monitor performance effectively.
**Approach:**\
**Automation and Integration:** Developed an automated grading system that integrated data from over 10 sources. This system eliminated the need for manual data handling.\
**Leveraging Existing Resources:** Reused transformed KPIs data and mapped them to individual consultants for specific durations, ensuring consistency and accuracy.\
**Metadata and Relationships:** Created detailed metadata for consultants and KPIs while building a robust data model that defined relationships between datasets.\
**Advanced Calculations:** Applied DAX functions to handle complex calculations, ensuring precise performance metrics for each consultant.\
**Centralized Monitoring:** Designed a centralized appraisal dashboard that provided real-time insights into consultant performance, enabling efficient monitoring and decision-making.\
**Impact:** The project transformed the appraisal process by automating data handling and calculations, addressing a 3-year backlog, and integrating over 10 data sources. The centralized dashboard became a single source of truth for consultant performance, fostering transparency and efficiency. This initiative set a benchmark for automated performance evaluation, demonstrating the power of data integration and innovation in professional practices management.\
