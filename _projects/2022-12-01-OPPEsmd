Goal: To streamline and automate the evaluation of professional practices by eliminating manual processes, enabling efficient performance monitoring, and addressing a 3-year backlog in consultant appraisals.
\
Challenges: The evaluation process relied heavily on manual data extraction, entry, and calculations across multiple sources for each consultant. This time-consuming approach led to inefficiencies, delays, and an inability to monitor performance effectively.
Approach:\
Automation and Integration: Developed an automated grading system that integrated data from over 10 sources. This system eliminated the need for manual data handling.\
Leveraging Existing Resources: Reused transformed KPIs data and mapped them to individual consultants for specific durations, ensuring consistency and accuracy.\
Metadata and Relationships: Created detailed metadata for consultants and KPIs while building a robust data model that defined relationships between datasets.\
Advanced Calculations: Applied DAX functions to handle complex calculations, ensuring precise performance metrics for each consultant.\
Centralized Monitoring: Designed a centralized appraisal dashboard that provided real-time insights into consultant performance, enabling efficient monitoring and decision-making.\
Impact: The project transformed the appraisal process by automating data handling and calculations, addressing a 3-year backlog, and integrating over 10 data sources. The centralized dashboard became a single source of truth for consultant performance, fostering transparency and efficiency. This initiative set a benchmark for automated performance evaluation, demonstrating the power of data integration and innovation in professional practices management.\
