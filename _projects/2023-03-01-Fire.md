**Goal:** To digitize the preventive maintenance process (PPM) for fire extinguishers, ensuring accurate tracking, historical data availability, and enhanced safety measures.
\
**Challenges:** The existing system lacked a structured PPM process, had no historical data, and relied on manual record-keeping and maintenance. This led to inefficiencies, missing records, and gaps in safety measures.
\
**Approach:**
\
**Digital Transformation:** Implemented QR code placement on over 1100 fire extinguishers, enabling digital tracking and seamless record updates.\
**Process Redefinition:** Redesigned the PPM checklist to standardize and streamline maintenance activities, ensuring comprehensive inspections.\
**Monitoring Dashboard:** Developed a centralized dashboard to track PPM progress, identify issues, and monitor key parameters such as location, hooking conditions, and weight.\
**Impact:** The project eliminated paper-based processes, reducing costs and creating a sustainable, eco-friendly system. Digital records provided accurate historical data, while the dashboard improved issue identification and resolution. Enhanced safety measures ensured better preparedness, contributing to overall patient and staff safety.
