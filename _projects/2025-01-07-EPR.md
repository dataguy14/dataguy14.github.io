**Goal:** The purpose of this project was to establish a centralized enterprise reporting system to monitor hospital services across multiple cities and departments, ensuring clinical and operational excellence. By integrating diverse datasets and standardizing reporting processes, the system was designed to enhance data visibility, streamline decision-making, and promote accountability at all organizational levels. The ultimate goal was to drive continuous improvement and alignment with enterprise objectives, including regulatory compliance and JCI reaccreditation.
\
**Project Overview:** At Shifa International Hospitals, I spearheaded the implementation of an Enterprise Reporting System to monitor clinical and operational performance across four sites and over 80 departments. The system centralized data from various sources, including:
\
**Finance:** Oracle Financials\
**PPMs:** Enterprise-wide medical equipment maintenance data\
**Patient Feedback:** Collected via QR codes and other tools\
**Internal Audits:** Observations and compliance data\
**Staff Health and Safety:** Incident reporting and safety metrics\
**Trainings:** Attendance and effectiveness tracking\
**Corporate Compliance:** Regulatory adherence data\
**KPIs:** Department-specific and cross-functional performance indicators
\
Using SQL, Oracle, MariaDB, Power BI Dataflows, and the Power BI stack, I built a robust pipeline to integrate and transform data from these diverse sources. The enterprise reporting model was structured into four levels to ensure hierarchical accountability and actionable insights:
\
**Level 1:** Data collection and processing through a robust BI pipeline.\
**Level 2:** Departmental reports shared with Heads of Departments (HODs), who conduct internal meetings and submit monthly action plans.\
**Level 3:** Aggregated reports with key insights shared with the Director of Operations, who convenes meetings with HODs to review and refine action plans for each site.\
**Level 4:** Enterprise-level meetings chaired by the CEO, where site directors discuss the implementation plans and requirements for Level 3 action items.\
This system transformed reporting from static and fragmented processes into a dynamic, enterprise-wide framework, providing actionable insights to stakeholders at every organizational tier.\
**Key Achievements:**
\
**Data Integration:** Centralized diverse datasets, enabling real-time performance monitoring.\
**Process Optimization:** Automated financial reporting and streamlined data pipelines for over 80 departments.\
**Operational Excellence:** Supported JCI reaccreditation by aligning reporting with international standards.\
**Sustainability Initiatives:** Collaborated with cross-functional teams to implement green initiatives.\
**Leadership and Collaboration:** Worked closely with stakeholders across multiple sites to achieve enterprise goals and ensure smooth system adoption.\
**This project not only improved data-driven decision-making but also fostered a culture of accountability and operational excellence across the organization.**
