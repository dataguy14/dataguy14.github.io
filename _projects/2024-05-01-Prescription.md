**Goal:** To bridge the gap between prescriptions generated in the EMR system and those dispensed at the pharmacy, ensuring compliance and preventing revenue leakage.
\
**Challenges:**
\
No Unique Identifier: Prescriptions dispensed at the pharmacy were not assigned the same unique ID as those generated in the EMR system.\
Lack of Visibility: Approximately 65% of prescriptions were bypassing the pharmacy, leading to significant business losses.\
System Gap: Disconnected processes between prescription issuance and fulfillment hindered effective monitoring and compliance.\
**Approach:**
\
**Gap Analysis:** Identified discrepancies between prescriptions issued and dispensed by analyzing data from the EMR system and pharmacy records.\
**Unique ID Assignment:** Designed a process to generate and assign unique IDs to prescriptions across both systems for seamless tracking.\
**Data Integration and Monitoring:** Integrated EMR and pharmacy data to provide leadership with a comprehensive compliance tracking dashboard.\
Impact:
\
**Revenue Recovery:** Addressed the gap that allowed prescriptions to bypass the pharmacy, reducing business losses.\
**Leadership Insights:** Equipped decision-makers with tools to monitor compliance closely and implement corrective measures.\
**Improved Processes:** Streamlined prescription tracking from issuance to dispensing, ensuring accountability and operational efficiency.\
**This project demonstrates my ability to identify critical system gaps, implement robust data integration solutions, and drive financial recovery through enhanced monitoring and compliance mechanisms.**
