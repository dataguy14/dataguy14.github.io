**Goal:** To enhance departmental performance by providing clear visibility into key metrics, incidents, and data collection activities through a centralized tracking system.
\
**Challenges:** Performance improvement required departmental-level visibility, but there was no unified system to track and present relevant data. Departments lacked the tools to monitor and analyze their performance effectively.
\
**Approach:**
\
**Unified Dashboard:** Designed and implemented a tracking dashboard tailored for each department, consolidating key data such as incidents, KPIs, and data collection forms.\
**Data Integration:** Integrated transformed KPI data with incidents and data collection forms, creating a cohesive and comprehensive performance monitoring system.\
**Handover Process:** Ensured smooth handover of the dashboard to departments, providing them with the tools and training needed for independent monitoring and analysis.\
**Impact:** The project empowered departments with improved performance monitoring at lower hierarchy levels, fostering accountability and driving targeted improvements. By consolidating key data into an accessible dashboard, departments gained actionable insights, enhancing operational efficiency and effectiveness.
