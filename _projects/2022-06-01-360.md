**Goal:** To modernize the 360-degree feedback process by creating an efficient, paperless system for feedback collection, analysis, and training recommendations.
\
**Challenges:** The traditional feedback system relied on hardcopy forms, making it time-intensive and challenging to distribute and manage across the organization.
\
**Approach:** Collaborative Framework: Worked closely with HR to design a hierarchy matrix, ensuring feedback collection aligned with organizational structure.\
**Digital Transformation:** Developed a cost-effective digital feedback collection system using Google Forms and Power BI services, enabling efficient distribution and real-time access.\
**Data Processing:** Implemented robust data collection, transformation, and analysis processes with a grading system for comprehensive feedback visualization.\
**Impact:** The project successfully transitioned the feedback process to a paperless system, reducing time and resource usage. The digital platform streamlined feedback distribution, collection, and analysis while providing actionable insights for training recommendations.
\
**This initiative showcases my ability to collaborate across departments, design cost-effective digital solutions, and deliver impactful systems that enhance organizational processes and decision-making.**
