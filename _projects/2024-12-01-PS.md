**Goal:** To revolutionize patient feedback collection, analysis, and compliance monitoring through a streamlined, digital, and paperless system powered by machine learning.
\
**Challenges:** The traditional process involved 4,000 paper feedback forms monthly, manual data entry, and delayed reporting. These inefficiencies led to slower response times, higher operational costs, and limited actionable insights.
\
**Approach:**
\
**Digital Feedback Collection:** Deployed QR codes at interaction points linked to Google Forms, eliminating the need for paper-based feedback.\
**Automated Analysis:** Utilized Python-based machine learning for sentiment analysis, comment categorization, and automatic tagging. Developed a comprehensive compliance monitoring system using key metrics such as questionnaire scores, submission rates, and AI-driven response quality.\
**Data Integration and Visualization:** Integrated feedback data into Google Sheets for storage and used Power BI to create dynamic dashboards for real-time insights on trends, sentiment, and compliance.\
**Impact:**
\
**Financial Savings:** Achieved annualized savings of PKR 605,000 by eliminating printing and reducing data entry costs.\
**Environmental Benefits:** Reduced paper consumption saved 6 trees annually, conserved ~2,400 gallons of water, and reduced COâ‚‚ emissions by 144 kg annually.\
**Enhanced Engagement and Compliance:** Real-time feedback resolution improved patient engagement, while 360-degree compliance monitoring ensured high response rates and actionable insights.\
**Strategic Value:** Provided data-driven insights to support CEO-level decisions, positioning the organization as an industry leader in digital patient feedback systems.\
<ins>**This project demonstrates my ability to leverage machine learning and data-driven strategies to transform legacy processes into innovative solutions that enhance operational efficiency, patient satisfaction, and environmental sustainability.**
