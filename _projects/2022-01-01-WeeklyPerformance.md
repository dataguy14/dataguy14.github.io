The purpose of this project was to automate and streamline the weekly hospital performance monitoring and decision-making process, eliminating the inefficiencies and inaccuracies associated with manual data extraction, analysis, and reporting. By integrating multiple data sources—including Oracle, SQL, Google Sheets, and Smart Sheets—into a unified, real-time data pipeline, the project aimed to provide timely and accurate insights to hospital leadership. The automation of data extraction, transformation, and visualization through Power BI ensures that decision-makers receive up-to-date, actionable information without the delays and errors of manual processes. Ultimately, this project was designed to enhance operational efficiency, improve decision-making, and support continuous improvement in hospital performance.
