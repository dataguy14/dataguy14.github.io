**Goal:** To enhance workforce utilization across multiple sites and projects by identifying free, available, and booked employees, as well as addressing shortfalls or surpluses for upcoming demands.
\
**Challenges:**
\
**Fragmented Data:** Workforce data was scattered, making it difficult to assess availability and demand accurately.\
**Data Quality Issues:** Inconsistent data collection and entry practices led to inaccuracies in workforce tracking.\
**Lack of Visibility:** Absence of a centralized system to monitor staff utilization across various sites and projects.\
**Approach:**
\
**Understanding Client Needs:** Conducted workshops to understand the clientâ€™s business requirements, data sources, and terminologies.\
**Data Processing:** Addressed data cleanliness issues through transformation, integration, and modeling to prepare it for analysis.\
**Data Health Reporting:** Created a detailed report highlighting data collection challenges and proposed a structured system for better data acquisition.\
**Visualization Evolution:** Initially built interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize workforce status. Later transitioned to Apache Superset for visualization using a Docker desktop setup, ensuring a scalable and efficient solution.\
**Impact:**
\
**Enhanced Workforce Visibility:** Provided insights into workforce status, helping identify free, booked, and surplus employees for specific timelines.\
**Proactive Planning:** Enabled the client to address workforce shortfalls proactively, optimizing project staffing and resource allocation.\
**Improved Data Practices:** Delivered a structured data collection system and insights, driving better data quality and decision-making.\
**This project demonstrates my ability to collaborate with clients to understand their needs, design data-driven solutions, and adapt to new technologies to deliver scalable and impactful results.**
